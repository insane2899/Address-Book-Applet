# Address-Book-Applet
This is an Applet made with Java 8 and Swing on Eclipse IDE

The Applet when run shows a page like this:

From there if we want to edit an already created addressbook then we click 'Edit Existing'. Otherwise, we click 'Create New'.

Once 'Create New' is Clicked then this dialog box appears:

Here we need to put the name of the new address book.

Once we put a name and create we enter the data table page. Here if we click edit from the menu bar and click on add we can add new entry. If we click on sort by name the data gets sorted. If we click delete and enter the index number of the data that needs to be removed the data gets removed.

The project has some scope of improvement in the fields of look and feel specially. Other than that I need to add a lot more functionalities like size adjustment of the table and all. I will provide the new updates in future.
